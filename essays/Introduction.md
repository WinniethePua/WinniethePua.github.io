Hi guys! My name is Pua, I am from the North Shore of Oahu, and I am currently a student at the University of Manoa majoring in MIS. At home I have five sisters (I am the second oldest) and we own three dogs and one bird.

I was previously an Accounting major, however I decided to switch to MIS because I found that I like being on my computer more than working with numbers. Plus, MIS is still a part of the Shidler program, which made switching my major a bit easier.

I look forward to seeing all of you in class! <3
