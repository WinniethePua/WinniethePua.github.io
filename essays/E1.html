  <p>BrowserHistory1 was really insightful to me since I had basically zero prior knowledge of how coding works. Being able to create, from scratch, a fully functioning website that is operating from a server on your computer is pretty impressive and Iâ€™m excited to progress my skills as we move on in the semester. I believe the first WOD took me about 18 minutes to complete on my final try, which sounds like a long time, but it was actually the average amount of time. I think I did it about 3 or 4 times, however, I was not able to make it to the end of the recording each time. I would sometimes forget what code I am supposed to put, so I would stop recording, look for what I am missing, and restart (which actually happens for the next two WODs as well).</p>

<p>BrowserHistory2 got difficult when we had to add pictures and change the fonts. I liked learning how to use the .css file because it made the website look a lot better and it was fun to mess around with the format of the website. I was able to finish super fast (about 5 minutes) on my last try (with about 3 tries), but not without watching the tutorial at least once. I was able to save time by downloading the fonts I needed (which was super easy) so that the fonts would show up in my font family.</p>

<p>BrowserHistory3 also got confusing for me when we had to put the paragraphs into columns, so I needed help from the video. Once I got the code down, the rest came pretty easy! Lots of floating involved in this one, which is something I now understand better. I was also able to finish this WOD in the prescribed time with only maybe 2 tries.</p>

<p>My advice for these WODs would be to try to figure it out on your own first before going to the video. When I got stuck, I would search the web for some information that would help me out, especially for figuring out what code to use and understanding how the code works. This is what I did when I downloaded the fonts I needed, which actually saved me a lot of time compared to if I only watched the video. I hope you found something useful for you (or at least interesting) in my essay. Good luck to the current and future students of ITM 352, you got this!</p>
